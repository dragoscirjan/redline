# Contributing

## Development model

Use GitHub Issues for defects, features, and acceptance criteria. Keep product documentation and design decisions under `docs/`, rendered with VitePress. Link implementation pull requests to relevant docs and GitHub Issues.

The repository is in its bootstrap phase. The POC uses npm, TypeScript, esbuild, Vitest, and the shared Tempel ESLint and Prettier configurations. Mise manages tool versions and project tasks. Do not add a second package manager, task runner, formatter, or test framework without an accepted design change. Follow `package-lock.json`, `mise.toml`, and the scripts in `package.json`.

The current milestone supports forge-specific GitHub, Forgejo, and Gitea action entry points developed in parallel, OpenCode and Pi, configured existing model endpoints, hosted runners, and forge-appropriate publication credentials. `model-config` selects an explicitly permitted remote/private provider endpoint and model; `model-credentials` supplies separate named bearer or API-key credentials. See the provider-neutral model configuration documentation under `docs/` and its tracking issue. Both backends run in the fixed container sandbox without checkout, host mounts, or GitHub credentials. Generate native harness configuration inside the container and pass only the selected provider credential. Reject arbitrary native config, commands, headers, and ambient environment references. Podman is the default and Docker is the only fallback. Managed local-runtime lifecycle, enforced-egress gateway, and self-hosted runner support remain separate work.

## Set up the repository

Mise installs Node.js 24 and Python 3.12, and npm is the only supported package manager.

```bash
mise trust
mise run deps:sync
```

Run `mise tasks` to list the available tasks. Use `mise run <task>` when a task exists. Dependency installation also configures Husky hooks: staged files are linted and formatted before commits, and the test suite runs before pushes.

## Before starting

1. Read `AGENTS.md` and the linked issue.
2. Read relevant requirements and design pages in the Wiki.
3. Confirm the acceptance criteria and security impact.
4. Check the working tree for existing changes.
5. Create a focused branch from `main`.
6. Check out the branch in a dedicated worktree at `../redline--workspaces/<branch-name>`. Perform all implementation, validation, and commits in that worktree rather than the primary checkout.

Do not start implementation when the requirement changes authentication semantics, comment ownership, trust boundaries, or forge compatibility without a corresponding design update.

## Branches and pull requests

- Every new feature or issue must use its own branch, dedicated worktree, and pull request.
- Do not commit directly to `main`.
- Keep one logical change per branch and pull request.
- Do not mix formatting sweeps or unrelated refactors with product changes.
- After implementation and validation, commit the change, push the branch, and open a pull request.
- Describe the user-visible behavior, security impact, tests, and documentation changes in the pull request.
- Link the issue that defines the acceptance criteria.
- Never merge a pull request unless the owner explicitly instructs you to merge it. Approval or successful review alone is not permission to merge.

## Implementation rules

- Write new production code in TypeScript unless an accepted design requires another language.
- Provide forge-specific action entry points (including `github/action.yaml` and a Gitea-compatible manifest under `gitea/`) and develop them in parallel. Their engines and manifest formats differ; keep review flow in shared core code and forge integration in adapters.
- Keep the review domain independent from forge SDKs, action runtimes, Pi, and OpenCode.
- Add forge-specific behavior through adapters.
- Add authentication methods through credential providers. Never branch on authentication mode throughout the domain layer.
- Put Pi and OpenCode behind one review-backend interface.
- Put Ollama, LM Studio, llama.cpp, OpenRouter, and later model tools behind model-runtime adapters.
- Keep runtime lifecycle separate from review-backend configuration.
- Track ownership for every server process and loaded model. Cleanup must not affect resources that existed before the action.
- Validate all model output before using it.
- Keep backend tools and permissions read-only during reviews.
- Keep review instructions fixed and versioned. Do not add free-form trusted guidance; repository content and action context must remain explicitly delimited untrusted data.
- Do not execute code from the pull request under review.
- Keep forge credentials in the publication and API-client layers. Give a review backend only the model-provider credential it needs. Do not write credentials into the checkout or prompt.
- Use least-privilege tokens and short-lived GitHub App installation tokens.

## Tests

Each pull request must add or update tests for changed behavior.

Use these test levels:

- Unit tests cover pure review policy, parsing, validation, filtering, and mapping.
- Contract tests cover forge event payloads and API request or response translation.
- Integration tests cover Pi and OpenCode setup, action input parsing, authentication providers, model-runtime lifecycle, and multi-component flows with controlled dependencies.
- End-to-end tests may write to a dedicated test repository only. They must never target a production repository.

Tests must use temporary directories and repositories. They must not modify the contributor's checkout. Network tests must be opt-in and clearly named.

The required `npm run evaluation` quality gate is deterministic, recorded, offline, and credential-free. Seed fixtures are inert JSON data and must never be imported or executed. The specialist gate must replay recorded per-dimension outputs (synthesized into one all-dimension shard output per case) and merge-pass recordings through the production orchestrator and compare forced-sharded and auto results with the single-pass baseline. Repository review memory remains disabled in the protected quality corpus so suppression cannot improve measured precision, recall, mapping, or clean accuracy; focused synthetic tests cover exact-base regular-file acquisition, matching, protected selectors, preference-only inline ordering, and post-validation accounting separately. Repository-declared memory authors are reviewed file content, never authenticated forge identities; review the exact-base memory change and its provenance reference as code. Changes to the protected corpus, specialist recordings, shard/selector/merge-pass semantics, memory semantics, matching semantics, or either threshold file require explicit owner review. `npm run evaluation:live` is an opt-in observational run only; it must not become a required CI gate or receive a GitHub publication token.

Before pushing, run every formatting, type-checking, linting, evaluation, and test command defined by the repository:

```bash
mise run validate
```

## Security review

Treat every pull request diff, file, filename, comment, and configuration value as untrusted input.

A change requires explicit security review when it:

- Adds a tool or permission available to Pi or OpenCode.
- Adds or changes a model-runtime command, executable path, endpoint, health check, model download, or cleanup rule.
- Executes a repository command.
- Changes token permissions or secret storage.
- Changes prompt construction, specialist/arbiter orchestration, or model-visible context.
- Changes repository review-memory parsing, matching, expiry, suppression, preference, or audit semantics.
- Changes managed-comment ownership checks.
- Adds support for public fork pull requests.
- Sends source code to a new model provider.

Never include real tokens, GitHub App private keys, webhook secrets, or model credentials in fixtures, logs, snapshots, prompts, or issue comments.

## Releasing the action

The supported consumer references are immutable `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` tags and the moving compatibility tag for that major, such as `v1.0.0` and `v1`. Branch names, pull request refs, and arbitrary commit references are not supported release channels. Never create, move, or delete release tags by hand.

### One-time repository setup

Before the first dispatch:

1. Create a protected GitHub environment named `release`. Configure required reviewers and restrict deployments to `main`. Create it explicitly—otherwise GitHub can auto-create an unprotected environment when the workflow first references it.
2. Configure repository tag rules for the `v*` namespace. Immutable full-version tags must not be updated or deleted. The trusted release workflow must be allowed to create full-version tags and atomically advance the matching `vMAJOR` alias; ordinary users and workflows must not.
3. Keep the workflow's top-level permissions empty. Preflight receives only `contents: read`; only the environment-gated publisher receives `contents: write`.
4. Confirm required branch checks and the release/tag rules with a repository administrator before dispatching.

Tag rules must distinguish the intentionally moving major alias from immutable full-version tags, or grant the trusted publisher an appropriately narrow bypass. Do not weaken immutable-tag protection merely to let `vMAJOR` move.

### Version selection

The operator does not choose a version or bump. Preflight inspects validated published releases and non-merge Conventional Commits from the highest published stable release to the exact current `main` revision:

- `type!:` or `type(scope)!:`, or a trailing `BREAKING CHANGE:` / `BREAKING-CHANGE:` footer, selects a major release;
- any `feat` commit selects a minor release when no breaking change exists;
- every other valid Conventional Commit history selects a patch release;
- the first stable release is always `v1.0.0`.

Malformed, empty, excessive, oversized, non-ancestor, orphaned, or ambiguous history fails closed. Merge commits are excluded, while their conventional branch commits remain in the range.

### Dispatch and approval

Use **Actions → Release versioned action → Run workflow**, select `main`, and run it without inputs. The equivalent CLI command is:

```bash
gh workflow run release.yml --repo dragoscirjan/redline --ref main
```

Preflight validates and rebuilds the repository, proves the committed bundles are clean, derives the exact version, and performs no writes. After the `release` environment is approved, the privileged job checks out and executes only the reviewed `dist/action-release.js` bundle. Immediately before its first mutation, the publisher revalidates that the captured target is still current `main`. Once mutation starts, that invocation remains bound to the captured version and target and may finish if `main` advances concurrently. A later dispatch or failed-job rerun cannot publish that older target.

### Verification

After a successful run, verify the immutable tag and stable GitHub Release target the dispatched `main` commit, and inspect the moving major alias:

```bash
git ls-remote https://github.com/dragoscirjan/redline.git \
  refs/tags/v1 refs/tags/v1.0.0
gh release view v1.0.0 --repo dragoscirjan/redline \
  --json tagName,isDraft,isPrerelease,targetCommitish,url
```

Substitute the version selected in the preflight log. The immutable full-version tag must always resolve directly to the dispatched commit, and the release must be published, stable, and attached to that tag. Immediately after publication, `vMAJOR` must resolve to the same commit; if a later same-major release has since shipped, it must instead resolve to that latest validated stable release.

### Retry and recovery

A dispatch against an already released current `main` is a no-op. If a run fails after a write, inspect tags and the GitHub Release before doing anything manually. GitHub API visibility can lag behind a successful tag or Release write; rerunning the failed jobs against the same unchanged `main` safely revalidates the uniquely expected state:

```bash
gh run rerun RUN_ID --repo dragoscirjan/redline --failed
```

Do not retry an old release after `main` advances. The publisher intentionally rejects stale ancestor publication, conflicting tags, unexpected orphan tags, and ambiguous remote state. Never force-push a release tag or create the GitHub Release manually to bypass a failed check.

### Rollback limitations

Published `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` tags are immutable and releases are not rolled back by moving or deleting them. Correct a bad release with a reviewed fix-forward commit and a new release. The guarded workflow is the only supported mechanism for advancing `vMAJOR`; consumers requiring a permanently fixed revision should pin the immutable full-version tag.

The detailed trust boundaries and operator checklist are in the Wiki's [Release operations](https://github.com/dragoscirjan/redline/wiki/Release-operations) runbook.

## Documentation

Update documentation in the same pull request when behavior or configuration changes. Before writing or editing documentation under `docs/`, read and follow `.agents/skills/unslop/SKILL.md`. Keep `AGENTS.md` and this file current when the development approach changes. Before changing either file, inform the owner what needs to change and ask for permission; do not edit them until permission is granted.

- Keep `README.md` focused on installation, configuration, and basic use.
- Keep contribution workflow in this file.
- Keep instructions for coding agents in `AGENTS.md`.
- Keep product documentation, requirements, and low-level design under `docs/`; render documentation with VitePress.
- Use `.agents/skills/unslop/SKILL.md` whenever writing or editing documentation.
- Record unsupported behavior and limitations.
- Use concrete names, defaults, examples, and failure behavior. Avoid claims that are not backed by code or tests.

## Commits

Use Conventional Commits with the linked GitHub issue number as the scope. The Husky `commit-msg` hook enforces this format:

```text
feat(#21): add GitHub App credential provider
fix(#22): reject comments outside changed lines
docs(#23): document PAT review identity
test(#24): cover renamed files in diff mapping
```

Keep commits reviewable. A commit should build and pass the relevant tests unless the pull request documents why an intermediate commit cannot do so.
